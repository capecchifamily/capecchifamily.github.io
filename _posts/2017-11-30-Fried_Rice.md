A Thai cookbook Steph and I got from Smile Organic Farm Cooking School that we went to outside of Chiang Mai Thailand while on honeymoon. It’s been adapted to my taste.

### Instructions:  
  
Make the rice first, having it ready before you start cooking the rest.  
Mix the sugar, oyster and soy sauce and set aside (I like to double the sugar/soy).  
Heat the olive oil in a wok over high heat and wait until smoking before proceeding. (I’ve never had the heat up too high- you’re adding a lot of stuff which will dissipate the heat, so go nuts).  
Swirl the pan to coat in oil, then add the chicken, turning occasionally to brown, 3-5 minutes.  
Add the eggs and stir consistently until cooked, ~1min.  
Add the garlic and veggies, cook for a few minutes to get the heat back up.  
Once veggies are slightly browned, add rice, sauce, and crushed red pepper, stir to mix.  
Continue stirring to avoid burning until the rice makes a good popping noise.  
Option to keep cooking if you like it to crisp up a bit. Stir in green onions just before turning off the heat.  
Pack into little bowls, place plate on top, then flip for a fancy presentation.

### Notes:  
  
Delicious with some diced pineapple. We’ve also made this with lots of other veggies- peas are good, chopped green cabbage gives a really nice flavor. Try things out, add good combos to this document!
