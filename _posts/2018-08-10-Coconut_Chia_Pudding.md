### Ingredients:  
  
- 14 oz full fat coconut milk (one can)  
- ¼ c. chia seeds  
- 1 Tbsp honey  
- 1 tsp vanilla  
- ½ c. blueberries or fresh fruit and/or nuts of choice

### Instructions:  
  
Whip the coconut milk to emulsify the fat into the liquid.  
Mix all ingredients (except fruit) together and pour into half-pint mason jars.  
Let sit in the refrigerator overnight and enjoy it the next day topped with any fruit or nuts you’d like.

### Notes:  
  
This makes four servings, about four ounces each.  Make ahead for a quick grab-and-go breakfast.  If you remember/have time, give the pudding one last stir before you head off to bed to help distribute the Chia seeds evenly.
