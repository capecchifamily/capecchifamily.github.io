### Instructions:  
  
Preheat oven to 425F. Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet with the coconut oil.  
In a large bowl, mix together the coconut aminos, sesame oil, fish sauce, coconut flour, scallions, and ginger. Add the pork and ix with your hands until well combined.  
Roll into golf ball-sized balls and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until thoroughly cooked and golden.

### Notes:  
  
You can skip the greasing if you’re using Silpats. These are a delicious and quick recipe, and make excellent leftovers. For an easy meal we usually just serve with some steamed broccoli.
