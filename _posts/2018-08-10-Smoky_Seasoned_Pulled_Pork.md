### Instructions:  
  
1.  Combine cumin, brown sugar, garlic powder, smoked paprika and salt; rub on pork roast.

2.  Place roast in a lightly greased 5- to 7-quart slow cooker.

3.  Cover and cook on LOW 10 to 12 hours or until pork is very tender.

4.  Shred pork; toss with sauce.

5.  Serve on buns

### Notes:  
  
I don’t typically toss this in the sauce.  I skim the fat off of the juices from the slow cooker (if time permits, put the juices in the refrigerator overnight so the fat will harden), and then toss the pork in its juices after shredding.  People can top their own sandwiches with the BBQ sauce of their choice.
