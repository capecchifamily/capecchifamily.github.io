### Origin:

 Mom’s recipe.

### Ingredients:

- 12 eggs
- 1 cup Mazola Corn Oil
- 1 oz bottle anise extract OR 1.5 oz anise seeds
- 2 cup sugar
- 8 cup flour
- 2 tsp baking powder

### Instructions:
This recipe makes a “double batch.” Stir together flour and baking powder; set aside. In a large bowl beat eggs with fork; gradually stir in (in any order) oil, sugar, and flavoring. Stir in dry ingredients. NOTE: You could use other oils but it would change the flavor; also, I used canola oil once and in a couple of weeks the pizzelles tasted rancid, which never happened with corn oil.
