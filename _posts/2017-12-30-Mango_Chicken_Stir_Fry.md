### Instructions:  
  
Make the rice:  
Break the cauliflower into florets, removing the stems. Place the florets in the food processor bowl and pulse until the cauliflower looks like rice, about 10 pulses. Place the coconut oil in a medium saucepan and heat over medium-high heat for 2 inutes. Add the cauliflower and salt, toss with a rubber spatula until the rice is coated with the oil, then cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. (Or make regular rice the regular way). Meanwhile…  
  
Prep the chicken:  
Pound the chicken to 1/2 -inch thickness between two pieces of plastic wrap with the smooth side of the meat hammer, then cut it crosswise into ½-inch-wide strips. Place the chicken in a bowl and toss with the alt, pepper, and arrowroot powder.  
  
Prep the veggies:  
Cut the onion and bell pepper into thin slices. Peel the mangoes and cut them into ½-inch chunks; if you do this over a bowl, you can use the mango juice in the sauce. Slice the jalapeno into rings.  
  
Make the sauce:  
Place all the sauce ingredients in a pint-size Mason jar and shake it like you mean it.  
  
Cook the chicken:  
Warm the coconut oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, 2-3 minutes. Add the chicken and toss to coat it in the oil, then let it cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes. While it cooks, wash the bowl (or grab a new one) for the cooked chicken. Flip the chicken and stir-fry until it’s golden and almost cooked through, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer the chicken to the bowl.  
  
Stir-fry!  
Place the onion, bell pepper, jalapeno, and mango in the skillet and stir-fry until the veggies are crisp-tender, 2-3 minutes. Return the chicken to the skillet and stir to combine. Add the sauce and stir-fry until thickened and bubbly, 1-2 minutes. Remove the lid from the rice and mix in the cilantro leaves.

### Notes:  
  
First off, of course regular rice works. We also use chicken thighs instead of breasts. Careful with the spiciness, I’ve made this where it was borderline inedible!  
Also, we’ve used frozen mango chunks from the freezer section (fresh mangoes weren’t available at the time) and they worked just fine as well.  
A note in the cookbook mentions that in order to make this Whole30 compliant, substitute 1 tsp hot sauce and 2 cloves minced garlic for the chili sauce.  
I find the arrowroot powder is key, making the sauce thick and sticky instead of runny.
