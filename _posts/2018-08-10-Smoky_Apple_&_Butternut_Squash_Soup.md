### Instructions:  
  
In a large saucepan, heat oil and butter over medium heat; add onions and chili powder; cook and stir until onions are tender, about 10 minutes.  
Add squash, apples, apple juice, chicken broth, salt and pepper; bring to boil.  
Cover and cook on low heat until apples and squash are very soft, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.

### Notes:  
  
Sour cream is a must. Served with a nice sourdough bread and butter- MMMMMHMMM!! Might want to cut the chipotle chili powder in half and test it. It can get spicy!
