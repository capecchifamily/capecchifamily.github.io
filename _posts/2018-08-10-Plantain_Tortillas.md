### Instructions:  
  
Preheat the oven to 350F  
Peel the plantains by cutting off the tops and bottoms and slicing through the skin along the length of the plantain.  
Roughly chop the plantains and place in the bowl of a food processor or high-speed blender.  
Add the egg whites, melted lard, salt, and lime juice. Blend until very smooth.  
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (or work in batches if you only have one).  
Grease the parchment paper liberally.  
Using a small ladle or disher, drop four ¼-cup portions of batter onto each pan, leaving plenty of room between each one.  
Using the ladle and/or a rubber spatula, smooth out the batter into thin circles. Get them as thin as you can while still keeping them intact.  
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until they are dry to the touch and just starting to brown at the edges. If using two pans at once, switch halfway through.  
Repeat with the remaining batter, making sure to grease the parchment paper each time.

### Notes:  
  
These store, freeze, and reheat beautifully. Reheat them over a gas flame for 20 seconds on each side, turning as needed, or in the oven or on a grill.  
These are seriously good tortillas. Would recommend. Obviously.
