I'm hoping this site can provide an easy way for us to share and preserve some of our favorite recipes! If you're like me, I never seem to have the recipe I want on hand, and inevitably revert to asking long strings of unanswerable questions like "What was that thing we had that one time?..."

So here we are. A repository of family classics and favorites. It definitely loses that  *je ne sais quoi* being online and not a yellowing 3x5 card covered in food stains, but it's accessible, and hopefully an easy way for us to share. So here are some (hopefully easy) steps to get your recipes online!

### How to Add a New Recipe

First, make sure you can access this **[Google Drive Recipes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Cy4220EerEKfIJFyoO2B7DD2xV7bGXBm "Link to Recipes Folder")** folder.
The files here are .md "markdown" files, and are used to generate the recipe web pages. You can use any text editor (like Notebook) to edit them. This should make it accessible to everyone even if you don't have Word. If you're feeling ambitious, download Atom to view and edit markdown files, it's free.

If you'd like to work from a blank slate, make a copy of Recipe_Template.md, then rename and fill it out with your recipe information.
If you'd prefer to work with something that's already functional, just make a copy of another recipe, change the name, and edit the fields! 
This might help if you're having difficulty figuring something out, like how to add images.
That's it! Just save and leave the document there and it'll end up on the website!

Also feel free to add in your own notes or comments to other recipes!

### Images

If you're feeling ambitious, take some pictures! Photos of the process as well as the finished product are always nice 
accompaniments as the rest of us go through making your recipe! To place an image in your recipe, simply add this on its own line:

\![example.jpg]\(\images\example.jpg "image title")

(Replacing 'example.jpg' with the image name and extension). Then just drop the picture into **/Recipes/images/**. 
Any image extension should work (like .png). The images can be placed anywhere in the document, just make sure the 
formatting stays consistent with what's above and it should work out just fine. (If it doesn't I can always go take a 
look and fix it up). So please start uploading!
