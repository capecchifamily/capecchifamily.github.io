I'm hoping this site can provide an easy way for us to share and preserve some of our favorite recipes! If you're like me, I never seem to have the recipe I want on hand, and inevitably revert to asking long strings of unanswerable questions like "What was that thing we had that one time?..."

So here we are. A repository of family classics and favorites. It definitely loses that  *je ne sais quoi* being online and not a yellowing 3x5 card covered in food stains, but it's accessible, and hopefully an easy way for us to share. So here are some (hopefully easy) steps to get your recipes online!

### How to Upload a Recipe:

- First, make sure you can access this [Google Drive Recipes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Cy4220EerEKfIJFyoO2B7DD2xV7bGXBm "Link to Recipes Folder") folder
- Make a copy of **\_Recipe_Template_.docx** and rename it after your recipe
- Change the highlighted portions and include as much or as little info as you wish
- That's it! Just save and leave the document there and it'll end up on the website!

### Images

If you're feeling ambitious, take some pictures! Photos of the process as well as the finished product are always nice accompaniments as the rest of us go through making your recipe! To place an image in your recipe, simply add this on its own line:

<img> example.jpg

(Replacing 'example' with the image name). Then just drop the picture into **/Recipes/images/**. Any image extension should work (like .png). The images can be placed anywhere in the document, just make sure the formatting stays consistent with what's above and it should work out just fine. (If it doesn't I can always go take a look and fix it up). So please start uploading!
